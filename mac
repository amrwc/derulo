# Give your co-workers a quick information security lesson by derulo'ing them.
# Maybe next time they will remember to lock their machine.
# 
# What?
# The script instantly changes the desktop's background of the machine it's run
# on.
# 
# Why?
# If your workplace is friendly enough to pull off pranks and some of you care
# about information security, the one and only Jason Derulo will be a perfect
# reminder of how quickly damage can be done and that an unattended computer
# should be locked.
# 
# NOTE: The script is Mac-specific â€“ it uses snippets of AppleScript.
# 
# Usage:
# bash <(curl -s derulo.me/mac)
# 
# or:
# curl -s derulo.me/mac | bash -s
# 
# Custom image:
# curl -s derulo.me/mac | bash -s <url_to_img>

# Store the URL passed as an argument
customImgUrl="${1}"

# Generate a UUID for the image name -- when an image with the same file name
# is picked, the background won't change. Using a unique name every time solves
# the problem.
